Code produced for Liwc vocabulary evaluation

In order to reproduce my experiment you should have python 2.x and python NLTK libary installed.

For copyright purpose I am not including the lexicon or corpora used in this evaluation. 
I recommend you to contact the authors for each resource in order to obtain them. 
I may help you with this task if you wish :)

To run the evaluation, just run:

$ python Experiments.py

The output of the evaluation will be printed on the screen. There is no parameters. The file is just a simple python script.

If you wish to re-use my libraries to read the lexicons or corpus, please fell free. They come with no warranties :)
